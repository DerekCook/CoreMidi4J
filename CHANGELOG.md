## [Unreleased][unreleased]

Nothing so far.


## [1.6] - 2021-02-20

## Added

- Rebuilt the native library using the latest Xcode to support use on
  Apple Silicon (M1, arm64) Macs.


## [1.5] - 2020-10-24

### Fixed

- It is now possible to send long SysEx payloads split across multiple
  messages using the Java convention of leaving out the trailing
  `0xF7` byte on all messages except the last, and introducing
  continuation messages with a first byte of `0xF7` instead of the
  normal `0xF0`. Thanks to [@eclab](https://github.com/eclab) for
  identifying this in [Issue
  37](https://github.com/DerekCook/CoreMidi4J/issues/37).
- Synchronization is used to protect against non-thread-safe behavior
  by
  [`MidiSystem.getMidiDeviceInfo()`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/javax/sound/midi/MidiSystem.html?is-external=true#getMidiDeviceInfo())
  when using
  [`CoreMidiDeviceProvider.addNotificationListener()`](https://deepsymmetry.org/coremidi4j/apidocs/uk/co/xfactorylibrarians/coremidi4j/CoreMidiDeviceProvider.html#addNotificationListener(uk.co.xfactorylibrarians.coremidi4j.CoreMidiNotification))
  on non-Mac platforms. (To be protected you must always use
  [`CoreMidiDeviceProvider.getMidiDeviceInfo()`](https://deepsymmetry.org/coremidi4j/apidocs/uk/co/xfactorylibrarians/coremidi4j/CoreMidiDeviceProvider.html#getMidiDeviceInfo())
  instead of the one provided by `javax.sound.midi.MidiSystem`.)
  Thanks to [Mail√ºfterl s.r.o.](https://github.com/mailuefterl-sro)
  for identifying this in [Issue
  38](https://github.com/DerekCook/CoreMidi4J/issues/38).



## [1.4] - 2020-02-09

### Fixed

- The build would fail the first time, because a step that was
  required for the xcode build to find the JNI headers in the Java
  runtime was being performed by xcode itself, which was too late for
  the compile to detect it. But the build would succeed the second
  time, because the first attempt had set up the necessary link. This
  step is now performed by Maven itself before even invoking xcode, so
  it can work all in one attempt.

### Added

- CoreMidi4J can now notify your project when the MIDI environment has
  changed on any platform, not just on macOS. If CoreMIDI is not
  available to generate these notifications and you ask for them,
  CoreMidi4J will create its own daemon thread to periodically examine
  the MIDI environment and generate notifications when it changes.
- Assigned a stable automatic module name so this project can safely
  be used as a dependency in modular Java projects.
- Updated the JavaDoc builder version so the API documentation would
  include a search field. Also updated other Maven build components.
- Added continuous deployment using GitHub Actions so that the library
  jar is automatically built and uploaded as a release artifact
  whenever code is pushed to the master branch on GitHub.



## [1.3] - 2020-01-03

### Fixed

- Several issues with formatting device names for different kinds of
  MIDI hardware, thanks to
  [@jeremybernstein](https://github.com/jeremybernstein).
- A mistake in the sample code in the project Read Me, thanks to
  [@git-moss](https://github.com/git-moss).


## [1.2] - 2019-09-05

### Fixed

- We discovered we were using an unreliable mechanism for converting
  MIDI device names to a format we could share with Java, thanks to an
  [issue](https://github.com/DerekCook/CoreMidi4J/issues/29) raised by
  [iaguilera](https://github.com/iaguilera). Especially under JDK 11
  and when running from a JDK bundled into a standalone Mac
  application, devices other than the IAC Driver were showing up as
  `<Unknown device>`. We now use a slightly more complex but reliable
  mechanism, so device names should always be available.


## [1.1] - 2017-09-16

### Fixed

- Calling `close()` more than once on a `CoreMidiSource` would lead to
  a [crash](https://github.com/DerekCook/CoreMidi4J/issues/19) as the
  same block of memory was attempted to be freed more than once.
- Implemented the rest of the MIDI SPI contract for tracking and
  closing transmitters and receivers.
- We now close any devices (and their transmitters or receivers) when
  the underlying CoreMIDI device disappears.
- It turns out that Java instantiates many, many instances of our
  `CoreMidiDeviceProvider` class, each of which was getting added to
  the listener list to be notified when the MIDI environment changed,
  causing the device list to be rebuilt hundreds of times more than it
  needed to be. We now work around this by only calling the listener
  on the most-recently constructed instance.

### Added

- We now allow you to distinguish between multiple devices of the same
  type by showing the user-assigned name of the device (and of the
  port, if there is more than one port on the device), as discussed in
  [Issue 21](https://github.com/DerekCook/CoreMidi4J/issues/21).
  **This changes the names reported for many devices, as noted
  [here](https://github.com/DerekCook/CoreMidi4J#device-names).**
- If the user changes a device or port name while Java is running, the
  device information is properly updated, although the device itself
  retains its object-level identity and opened state.


## [1.0] - 2017-05-14

### Fixed

- A long-standing
  [crash or hang](https://github.com/DerekCook/CoreMidi4J/issues/10)
  when trying to use CoreMidi4J from JavaFX was
  [fixed](https://github.com/DerekCook/CoreMidi4J/pull/18) by
  [@mpsalisbury](https://github.com/mpsalisbury).
- You no longer
 [need to call](https://github.com/DerekCook/CoreMidi4J/issues/9)
 `System.exit()` to end your program even when
  MIDI environment changes have occurred while it was running.
- A potentially uninitialized variable was fixed in the native code.

### Changed

- Dependencies and build tools were updated to their latest releases.


## [0.9] - 2016-08-23

### Added

- A new static method `getLibraryVersion()` in
  `CoreMidiDeviceProvider` so that client software can determine the
  version of CoreMIDI4J which is in use. (If this method is not found,
  then the version is unknown, but must be 0.8 or earlier.)


## [0.8] - 2016-07-03

### Fixed

- The method name `removeNotificationListener()` in
  `CoreMidiDeviceProvider` was previously
  `removedNotificationListener()`, which was inaccurate.
- A variety of gaps in the API documentation were addressed.

### Changed

- Dependencies and build tools were updated to their latest releases.


## [0.7] - 2016-04-20

### Added

- The native library is now bundled inside the CoreMidi4J jar and
  extracted automatically when appropriate, so CoreMidi4J can be
  embedded in other projects, avoiding the need for end users to
  install anything.
- An enhanced version of `getMidiDeviceInfo()` is available for use in
  place of the standard one found in `javax.sound.midi.MidiSystem`.
  This version filters out the broken MIDI device implementations
  offered by the standard Mac Java MIDI environment.

### Fixed

- MIDI devices with null descriptons or vendors coming from the native
  library are no longer considered erroneous, and instead are given
  default values equivalent to what the standard implementations have.

### Changed

- The installation instructions no longer recommend installing
  CoreMidi4J as a Java extension, and recommend that you remove any
  older version you have placed in the Extensions directory.


## [0.5] - 2016-03-19

### Fixed

- Under certain settings for system languages, MIDI devices were
  showing up with null values for their names, descriptions and
  vendors.


## [0.4] - 2016-01-18

### Fixed

- MIDI Timestamps are now properly translated between Java and
  CoreMidi. This may be the only MIDI SPI which achieves this.


## [0.3] - 2016-01-09

### Fixed

- Running status bytes are now handled properly, as is interleaving of
  all other MIDI commands with bytes of System Exclusive messages.
- Multiple messages sent in the same packet, as well as multi-packet
  messages from CoreMidi are properly processed.

### Changed

- Further progress towards supporting MIDI timestamps.


## [0.2] - 2016-01-01

### Fixed

- Handling of MIDI Timing Clock messages interleaved within the bytes
  of incoming System Exclusive messages.

### Added

- Notifications of changes to the MIDI environment can now be
  requested.

- First steps towards supporting MIDI timestamps.


## 0.1 - 2015-12-22
